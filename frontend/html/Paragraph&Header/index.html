    <h1>Chickens</h1>
    <p>
      <b>The chicken (Gallus domesticus)</b>
      is a large and round short-winged bird, domesticated from the red
      junglefowl of Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago. Most chickens are
      raised for food, providing meat and eggs; others are kept as pets or for
      cockfighting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total
      population of 26.5 billion as of 2023, and an annual production of more
      than 50 billion birds. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per
      year. There are numerous cultural references to chickens in folklore,
      religion, and literature.
